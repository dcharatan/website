Frigid New England winters are not what comes to mind when one pictures surfing, yet the region hosts a thriving surf community. World-class waves can be enjoyed among thin crowds within a culture of some of the most dedicated surfers willing to sport thick neoprene and surf even in harsh winter conditions.

### Surfboard Trips

MITOC runs surf trips throughout the year to spots in the New England area. Surf trips are posted on the [trips page](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/trips/) and announced on the [mitoc mailing list](https://mitoc.mit.edu/mailing-lists) and [surfers mailing list.](https://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/surfers) We welcome surfers of all ability levels!

### Surfboard Rental

MITOC has several 8ft soft-top surfboards available for rental with approval from the [surf chair.](mailto:boathouse-mgr@mit.edu)

To rent surfboards on your own:

1. **Be a MITOC member.** Check that your [membership](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/) is active and your liability waiver is up to date.
2. **Be a boathouse keyholder.** In order to access the boathouse, you will need to attend boathouse keyholder training. Check the [upcoming trips page](https://mitoc-trips.mit.edu/trips/) or email the [boat chairs](mailto:boathouse-mgr@mit.edu) to find out when the next training is scheduled.
3. **Have deposit checks on file.** In order to rent gear, you need deposit checks on file to cover any damage or theft of boathouse equipment. Drop off deposit checks at MITOC office during [MITOC office hours](https://mitoc.mit.edu/calendar), prior to your trip. You will need two deposit checks ($300 and $700 in value). These checks are kept for one year, and you can rent (any MITOC gear) as often as you like without writing more checks.
4. **E-mail the [surf chair](mailto:boathouse-mgr@mit.edu)** to check for board availability and fill out a [surfing float plan form.](https://forms.gle/A4WZEaHvCCeYMTe39) 
5. **After your trip:** a brief report to the surf chair would be appreciated about any issues with the gear as well as any comments of interest about your experience. *Please rinse wetsuits with clean, fresh water after use and hang to dry. Please only return wetsuit gear to the boathouse when it is dry and clean.*

For more detailed information about renting surfboards, see the [boathouse rental page.](https://mitoc.mit.edu/rentals/boathouse)

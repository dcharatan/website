### General Guidelines for Reimbursement

*   Follow the instructions on this page carefully. If not, your reimbursement may be delayed or we will be unable to process it. If in doubt, email [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu).
*   **KEEP ALL RECEIPTS UNTIL REIMBURSED!!!** If you do not have proof of payment, you CANNOT be reimbursed.
*    To get reimbursed, you must submit an itemized receipt showing a zero/paid balance. If you do not have this, and invoice/receipt showing the items purchased AND a proof of payment (such as a credit card statement) will suffice. 
*   For Amazon orders, the receipt must show that the item has already shipped. This can be found under Your Account >> Your Orders >> Invoice AFTER the order has shipped.
*   Avoid cash.
*   All receipts should be in USD. If not, include screenshots of official conversions to USD.
*   Tip can be reimbursed with proof of payment.
*   Sales tax cannot be reimbursed; however, purchases made on MIT's behalf can be exempted from sales tax. Use the forms [here](http://vpf.mit.edu/forms/7/1220) (MIT certificates required) if vendors require proof of exemption. MITOC has tax exempt accounts with many large outdoor vendors. 
*   DO NOT pay more than $1000 for computers/software, or $5000 for other items. Large purchases must be made with requisitions. Email [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu) prior to placing large orders.
*   If you are paying a single individual (e.g. a speaker), you may need the payee to fill out a [W-9 form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) ahead of time.

4.  Follow the specific directions below:


{% template panel.html title: "Course Subsidies or course desk credit payment" id: "courses" %}

  Pay the course cost in full (to the provider, not MITOC).
  
  For a subsity, email both the leader coordinator and [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu) listing the course you will be reimbursed for & links to the led trips being used for the subsity. Then follow the directions on this page for "Other non-travel" that applies to you.

  For desk credit 'payment', the treasurer will reimburse you for the specified amount in the google form. Follow the directions on this page for "Other non-travel" that applies to you.

{% template panel.html title: "Travel/gas - with MIT certificates" id: "travel-cert" %}

  Ensure you have access to [Concur](http://concur.mit.edu/).

  1.  Create and fill out a report using the MITOC cost object/account: 2720209. Attach copies of all receipts, but DO NOT SUBMIT YET. For personal vehicle mileage, include a Google Maps printout of the route for mileage (gas receipts are not accepted). 
  2.  Generate a _Detailed Report with Allocation Summary_ from the Print/Email dropdown and send to [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu).
  3.  Treasurer will reply with a signed approval form, which should then be attached to Concur report and submitted.

  Personal mileage can be reimbursed using Concur, however, that reimbursement rate is determined by the [IRS standard mileage ](https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/standard-mileage-rates). 

{% endtemplate %}

{% template panel.html title: "Travel/gas - no MIT certificates" id: "travel-nocert" %}

  If you do not have access to the [Concur reporting tool](http://concur.mit.edu/), you must fill out a [travel voucher](http://studentlife.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Travel%20Voucher.pdf) and send to [mitoc-trez@mit.edu](mailto:mitoc-trez@mit.edu), with all receipts attached. For personal vehicle mileage, include a Google Maps printout of the route for mileage (gas receipts are not accepted).

  *   Go to [Atlas](http://atlas.mit.edu/) and click on “Full Catalog.” Under “My Reimbursements,” select “Request a Reimbursement for Me.”
  *   Fill out the RFP (“Request for Payment”), leaving the G/L Account and Cost Object values empty. Include a description of the expense and if it came out of a discretionary budget. For food reimbursements, include what it was for and roughly how many MIT students/affiliates/others attended. In the amount box, be sure to subtract sales tax for all items.
